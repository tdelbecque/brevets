• Abstract :
(FR2958129)
The applicator (1) has application elements (9) i.e. teeth, carried
by a single-strand core i.e. tubular sleeve, and projected with
respect to the core towards exterior of an application unit (8). A
drive system is rotationally movable with respect to a rod (2)
and coupled with the core in a site far away from another site
such that the rotational displacement of the system with respect
to the rod causes passage of the core from one configuration to
another configuration. An orientation of the core is coaxial to a
longitudinal axis (X) of the rod irrespective of the displacement
of the system. (From FR2958129 A1)

• Abstract :
(FR2941357)
The process involves bringing an extraction portion (20) of a
substrate in contact with a skin/hair in a treatment zone (22) of
a portable treatment system (10) so as to take care of fatty
substances present on the skin. The substrate is cleaned
relative to a gripping part (11) by aspiration, propulsion of a fluid
on the substrate, stretching/ compression of the substrate, set
in contact of the substrate with an extraction material,
thermolysis, photolysis, oxidation/reduction treatment, so as to
bring a new portion of the substrate in the zone and to start the
cleaning stage again. The extraction material has greater
affinity for the fatty substances than the substrate. The fatty
substance is a sebum. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also
included for a portable treatment system of skin or hair,
comprising a gripping part. (From FR2941357 A1)

• Abstract :
(EP2004757)
The invention relates to a dye composition comprising a
thiol/disulfide fluorescent dye comprising amino groups, and to
a dyeing process which has a lightening effect on keratin
materials, in particular keratin fibers, especially human keratin
fibers such as the hair, using said composition. It similarly
relates to novel thiol/disulfide fluorescent dyes and to uses
thereof in lightening keratin materials. This composition makes
it possible to obtain a particularly resistant and visible lightening
effect on dark keratin fibers. (From US8038732 B2)
